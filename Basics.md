- An application will have our js files, then the libraries like react and redux. These are in ES6 format. No browser has complete support for ES6. Its a syntatically different Javascript. We have to transpile ES6 to browser js. We use Webpack and babel for this. So webpack+babel converts all our code to single file understood by browser

- React is a JS library. We write individual components or views. Components are snippets of code that produce html. Component is a set of JS functions that produce html

- Components by default are not put into view. We need to specifically include the components that we want to be in html

-Const is ES6 syntax. Const is declaring a variable as var. But const variable cannot be reassigned.

-jsx is a subset of javascript that allows to write HTML inside js. This is then transpiled to normal HTML.
