- An application will have our js files, then the libraries like react and redux. These are in ES6 format. No browser has complete support for ES6. Its a syntatically different Javascript. We have to transpile ES6 to browser js. We use Webpack and babel for this. So webpack+babel converts all our code to single file understood by browser

- React is a JS library. We write individual components or views. Components are snippets of code that produce html.
